                                    <p>This floating solar plant of&#160;1076,4 kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation pond, located in Minamiawaji city, Hyogo prefecture, Kansai, Japan.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#169; floating solar system supports&#160;4032 panels (260Wp&#160;MITSUBISHI modules), and covers about 71,61 % of the water surface (1,11&#160;out of&#160;1,55 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#169; supply, solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of&#160;2&#160;m and a level variation of 2 m.</p>
<p>The construction&#160;lasted&#160;10 weeks&#160;and the grid connection was effective in June 2015.</p>
<p>This project was constructed on the dried pond.</p>
