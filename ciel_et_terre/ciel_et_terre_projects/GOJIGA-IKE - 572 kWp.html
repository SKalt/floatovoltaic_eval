                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 572 kWp is installed on an irrigation pond, located in Hyogo prefecture, Japan.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#174; floating solar system supports 2200 panels (260 Wp JINKO&#160;modules), and covers about 28&#160;% of the water surface (0.64 out of 2.32&#160;ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#174; supply, and solar island design and anchoring system design.&#160;The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet a maximum depth of 2.4&#160;m and a level variation of 2.4&#160;m.</p>
<p>The grid connection was effective in&#160;January 2017.</p>
