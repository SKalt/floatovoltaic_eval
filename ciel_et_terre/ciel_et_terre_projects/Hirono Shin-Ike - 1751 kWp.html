                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 1751 kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation reservoir, located in Hyogo&#160;prefecture, Japan.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio<sup>&#174;</sup> floating solar system supports 7005&#160;panels (250 Wp SHARP&#160;modules), and covers about 54 % of the water surface (1.92 out of 3.53 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#174; supply,&#160;solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 7.8 m and a level variation of 5.1 m.</p>
<p>The grid connection was effective in September&#160;2016.</p>
