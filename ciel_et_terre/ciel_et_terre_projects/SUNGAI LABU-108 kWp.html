                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 108&#160;kWp is&#160;installed on a water treatment pond, located in Sepang city, Selango, Malaysia.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#169; floating solar system supports 432&#160;panels (250 Wp ET SOLAR&#160;modules), and covers about 3,57&#160;% of the water surface (0,15 out of 4,20&#160;ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#169; supply and solar island design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 27&#160;m and a level variation of 20&#160;m.</p>
<p>The construction&#160;lasted 1&#160;week and the grid connection was effective in November 2015.</p>
