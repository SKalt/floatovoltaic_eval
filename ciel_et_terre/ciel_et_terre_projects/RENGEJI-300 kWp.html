                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 300&#160;kWp is&#160;installed on an water storage&#160;pond, located in Fukuoka city, Fukuoka prefecture, Kansai, Japan</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#169; floating solar system supports 1 200&#160;panels (250 Wp ZNShine Solar&#160;modules), and covers about 44&#160;% of the water surface (0,35 out of 0,79&#160;ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#169; supply,&#160;solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 5,3&#160;m and a level variation of 5,3&#160;m.</p>
<p>The construction&#160;lasted 6 weeks and the grid connection was effective in July 2016.</p>
