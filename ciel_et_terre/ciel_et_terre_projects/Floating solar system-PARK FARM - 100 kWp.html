                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 100&#160;kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation pond, located in Wrentham village, Suffolk, UK.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#169; floating solar system supports 400&#160;panels (250 Wp REC&#160;modules), and covers about 2,53&#160;% of the water surface (0,11 out of 4,34&#160;ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#169; supply,&#160;solar island design and anchoring system design, supply&#160;&amp; installation. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 4,3&#160;m and a level variation of 4,3&#160;m.</p>
<p>The construction&#160;lasted 2 weeks and the grid connection was effective in December 2015.</p>
