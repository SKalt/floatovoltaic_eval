                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 32&#160;kWp is installed on an irrigation reservoir, located in Orlando, the U.S.A.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#174; floating solar system supports 100&#160;panels (315 Wp RENESOLA&#160;modules), and covers about 2.90 % of the water surface (0.44 out of 1.22 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was EPC (Engineering &#8211; Procurement and Construction). We were in charge of Hydrelio&#174; supply, solar island and anchoring systems design and installation.&#160;The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet a maximum depth of 3.0&#160;m and a level variation of 0.45&#160;m.</p>
<p>The grid connection will be&#160;effective in February&#160;2017.</p>
