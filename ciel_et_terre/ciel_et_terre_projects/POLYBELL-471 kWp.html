                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 471,24 kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation pond, located in Gringley-on-the-hill village, South Yorkshire, UK.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#169; floating solar system supports 1848&#160;panels (255 Wp REC modules), and covers about 10,57 % of the water surface (0,5 out of 4,73&#160;ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#169; supply, solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 3,9 m and a level variation of 3,9 m.</p>
<p>The construction&#160;lasted 4 weeks&#160;and the grid connection was effective in December&#160;2015.</p>
