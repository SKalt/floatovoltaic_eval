                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 808,50&#160;kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation pond, located in Fukuzaki district, Hyogo prefecture, Kansai, Japan.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#169; floating solar system supports 3234&#160;panels (250 Wp SHARP&#160;modules), and covers about 28,13&#160;% of the water surface (0,92 out of 3,27 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#169; supply, solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 4,4 m and a level variation of 4,4 m.</p>
<p>The construction&#160;lasted 11 weeks&#160;and the grid connection was effective in February&#160;2016.</p>
