                                    <p>This floating solar plant of&#160;494,5 kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation dam, located in Cheongwon district, Chungcheonbuk, South Korea.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#169; floating solar system supports&#160;1978 panels (250Wp&#160;HANWHA modules), and covers about 1,14 % of the water surface (0,56&#160;out of&#160;49,12 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#169; supply, solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with deadweight was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of&#160;93,8&#160;m and a level variation of 8,3 m.</p>
<p>The construction&#160;lasted&#160;2 weeks&#160;and the grid connection was effective in February 2015.</p>
