                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 270&#160;kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation reservoir, located in Malaysia.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio<sup>&#174;</sup> floating solar system supports 900&#160;panels (300 Wp BLUESUN&#160;modules), and covers about 1.5 % of the water surface (0.27 out of 17.94 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#174; supply,&#160;solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 45.6&#160;m and a level variation of 17.5&#160;m.</p>
<p>The grid connection was effective in November&#160;2016.</p>
