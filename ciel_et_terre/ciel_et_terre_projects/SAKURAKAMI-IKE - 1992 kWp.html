                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 1992 kWp is installed on an irrigation reservoir, located in Hyogo prefecture, Japan.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#174; floating solar system supports 7810 panels (255 Wp YINGLI modules), and covers about 35 % of the water surface (2.49 out of 7.04 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#174; supply, solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet a maximum depth of 8.4 m and a level variation of 8.4 m.</p>
<p>The grid connection was effective in December 2016.</p>
