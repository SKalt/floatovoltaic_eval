                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 1428&#160;kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation pond, located in &#160;Inami town, Hyogo prefecture, Kansai, Japan.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#169; floating solar system supports 5712&#160;panels (250 Wp SHARP&#160;modules), and covers about 23,11&#160;% of the water surface (1,59 out of 6,88 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#169; supply, solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 6,4 m and a level variation of 6,4 m.</p>
<p>The construction&#160;lasted 12 weeks&#160;and the grid connection was effective in December&#160;2015.</p>
