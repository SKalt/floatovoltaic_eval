                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 24 kWp is installed on a water retention pond, the Panama Canal, in Panama.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#174; floating solar system supports 96 panels (250 Wp TRINA modules), and covers about 0.2 % of the water surface (0.03 out of 14.4 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#174; supply, and solar island design and anchoring system design.</p>
<p>The grid connection was effective in February 2017.</p>
