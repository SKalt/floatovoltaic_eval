                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 218&#160;kWp is&#160;installed on a hydroelectric dam, located in Montalegre, Portugal.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio<sup>&#174;</sup> floating solar system supports 840&#160;panels (260 Wp REC&#160;modules), and covers about 0.01 % of the water surface (0.26 out of 2212 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre operated as EPC (Engineering Procurement and Construction). We were in charge of Hydrelio&#174; supply, the design and construction of solar island, anchoring and electrical systems. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 90.0&#160;m and a level variation of 30.0&#160;m.</p>
<p>The grid connection was effective in November&#160;2016.</p>
