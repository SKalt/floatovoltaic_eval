                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 632 kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation pond, located in Tokushima prefecture, Japan</p>
<p>The Hydrelio<sup>&#174;</sup> floating solar system supports 2340&#160;panels (270 Wp KYOCERA&#160;modules), and covers about 57 % of the water surface (0.68 out of 1.19 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of all the project development : Hydrelio&#174; supply,&#160;solar island anchoring systems design, construction supervision, financing and operation and maintenance. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 6.0 m and a level variation of 6.0 m.</p>
<p>The grid connection was effective in October&#160;2016.</p>
