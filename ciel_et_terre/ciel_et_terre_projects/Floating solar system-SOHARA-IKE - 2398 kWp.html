                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 2397,60&#160;kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation pond, located in Matsusaka city, Mie prefecture, Chubu, Japan.</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#169; floating solar system supports 8880&#160;panels (270 Wp MITSUBISHI&#160;modules), and covers about 68,89&#160;% of the water surface (2,48 out of 3,60 ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#169; supply, solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 1,8 m and a level variation of 1,8 m.</p>
<p>The construction&#160;lasted 20 weeks&#160;and the grid connection was effective in March&#160;2016.</p>
