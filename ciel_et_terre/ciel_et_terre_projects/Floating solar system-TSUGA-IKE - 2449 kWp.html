                                    <p>This floating solar plant of 2449&#160;kWp is&#160;installed on an irrigation reservoir, located in Susuka&#160;city, Mie prefecture, Japan</p>
<p>The Hydrelio&#169; floating solar system supports 9072&#160;panels (270 Wp KYOCERA&#160;modules), and covers about 27 % of the water surface (2.48 out of 9.21&#160;ha).</p>
<p>For this project, Ciel &amp; Terre was in charge of Hydrelio&#169; supply,&#160;solar island design and anchoring system design. The bottom anchoring with percussive driven earth anchors was designed to meet&#160;a&#160;maximum depth of 7.2&#160;m and a level variation of 7.2 m.</p>
<p>The construction&#160;lasted 8 weeks and the grid connection was effective in July&#160;2016.</p>
